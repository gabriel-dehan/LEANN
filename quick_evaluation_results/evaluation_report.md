- AST chunking improves chunk coherence by 13.4%

### Performance Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Speed Ratio (AST/Naive) | 0.05x |
| Memory Ratio (AST/Naive) | 0.00x |
| Completeness Improvement | +2.89% |
| Coherence Improvement | +13.38% |

| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Recall@5 | +0.00% |
| Precision@5 | +0.00% |
| F1@5 | +0.00% |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Enable AST chunking for code-heavy repositories
1. Configure appropriate AST chunk sizes (512-768 characters)
1. Set up fallback to naive chunking for unsupported languages

### Configuration Guidelines

- **Ast Chunk Size**: 512-768 characters for optimal balance
- **Ast Chunk Overlap**: 64-96 characters for good continuity
- **Fallback Enabled**: True
- **Memory Limit**: Plan for 69MB+ memory usage
- **Timeout Settings**: Set 3-5x longer timeouts for AST processing

## Detailed Analysis

### Processing Performance

| Approach | Time (s) | Efficiency (chunks/s) |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| AST Chunking | 3.828 | 35.3 |
| Naive Chunking | 0.179 | 793.5 |

### Use Case Recommendations

**Code Heavy Repositories** üß†
- Repositories with primarily code files
- *Recommendation: Ast*
- *Reasoning: Better function boundary preservation and semantic understanding*

**Mixed Content** üîÑ
- Repositories with code and documentation
- *Recommendation: Conditional*
- *Reasoning: Use AST for code files, naive for documentation*

**Performance Critical** ‚ö°
- Applications where speed is paramount
- *Recommendation: Naive*
- *Reasoning: Lower processing overhead and memory usage*

**Semantic Search** üß†
- Applications requiring semantic code understanding
- *Recommendation: Ast*
- *Reasoning: Better preservation of code structure and context*

**Large Scale Indexing** üîÑ
- Indexing very large codebases
- *Recommendation: Conditional*
- *Reasoning: Depends on available resources and quality requirements*
