🎯 EXPLANATION: Why AST Appears Faster

  The speed measurements are technically correct but misleading due to different processing approaches:

  🔍 What's Actually Happening

  1. AST Chunking:
    - Uses astchunk library
    - Optimized C++ parsing under the hood
    - Direct tree traversal and chunking
    - Time: ~0.047s for 22 chunks
  2. "Naive" Chunking:
    - Uses LlamaIndex SentenceSplitter
    - Not actually "naive" - it's doing sophisticated sentence boundary detection
    - Includes paragraph separation, sentence parsing, overlap handling
    - Time: ~1.077s for 18 chunks

  📊 Corrected Understanding

  The speed comparison is actually:

  AST chunking (optimized library) vs LlamaIndex sentence splitting (sophisticated text processing)

  This is not a fair comparison because:
  - ✅ AST: Specialized, optimized code parsing
  - ❌ "Naive": Actually sophisticated text processing (sentence boundaries, etc.)

  🔧 Real "Naive" Implementation Would Be

  # True naive chunking (what we should compare against)
  def truly_naive_chunking(text, chunk_size=512, overlap=128):
      chunks = []
      start = 0
      while start < len(text):
          end = start + chunk_size
          chunks.append(text[start:end])
          start = end - overlap
      return chunks

  🎯 Accurate Interpretation

  The speed measurements show:
  - AST chunking: Fast, specialized code parsing
  - LlamaIndex chunking: Slower but more sophisticated text processing
  - Real advantage: AST preserves semantic boundaries while being fast
  - Memory efficiency: AST uses less memory (valid measurement)

  ✅ Corrected Summary

  Speed: AST chunking is faster than LlamaIndex's sentence-aware splitting (not truly "naive")

  Quality: AST chunking provides better semantic boundaries for code

  Memory: AST chunking genuinely uses less memory
